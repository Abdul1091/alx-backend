# Project Overview

The 0x00 Pagination Project demonstrates efficient
pagination in REST APIs. Pagination enables APIs
to handle and present large datasets in manageable
chunks, enhancing performance and usability.
This project provides basic pagination functionality
using query parameters, allowing users to fetch data
in smaller segments (pages) instead of all at once.

# Technologies Used

*Language: Python
*Framework: Flask (or another framework)
*Database: SQLAlchemy (or alternative ORM/database)
*Testing: Postman or Curl for API testing

# Key Concepts
1. Pagination: The process of dividing a dataset into
discrete pages to limit the amount of data processedat once.
2. Query Parameters: Parameters sent in the URL
(e.g., ?page=1&limit=10) to define the page number and
the number of items per page.
3. Limit and Offset: Common SQL or ORM features used
to fetch a subset of records.
